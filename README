REIgnore

A HexChat plugin which allows regex /ignore patterns

Synopsis: /REIGNORE [ADD|REMOVE|LIST|CLEAR] <mask> <types> <options> <pattern>

ADD - Add a new /reignore entry. This is the default action.

REMOVE - REMOVE a matching /reignore entry.

LIST - List all matching /reignore entries.

CLEAR - Clear all /reignore entries, functionally equivalent to
	`/reignore REMOVE *!*@*`

mask: Hostmask to match for the ignore.  This accepts wildcards * and ? and will
	match against nick!ident@host.  There are also extban-style matches that
	work here (see below).

types: One of PRIV, CHAN, NOTI, CTCP, DCC, INVI, ALL (currently DCC and INVI are
	not implemented)

options: NOSAVE, QUIET.

pattern: A regular expression pattern that must be matched for a message to be
	ignored.

Extban-style matches - The following masks are also possible:

$a: Matches a logged in account name.

$h: Matches the user's hostname in the form user@host.

$n: Matches the user's nickname.

$p: Matches any prefix such as @ or +.

$r: Matches the user's real name.

$x: Matches the full user!ident@hostname#gecos for the user.

If you follow the $ with a ~ character it reverses the sense of the match.
Examples:

Match the username "pj":
$a:pj

Match any user who is not a channel op:
$~:@

Match any user who does not have ops or voice in the channel:
$~p:?

Match anyone with the real name of "Joe Bloggs":
$r:Joe Bloggs

Match any user who is not logged in:
$a:
